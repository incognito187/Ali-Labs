To start the Solution outline, I first identified the core functionality from the requirement.

Solution should be based on cloud native infrastructure.

anticipated
generate

## Requirements

A client would like to build a new image sharing platform for people to use. This platform will take an image provided by a user, and create copies of it at multiple resolutions, and store them ready to be shared or downloaded.

Weâ€™d like you to create a cloud native infrastructure design you'd use to meet these requirements. You only need to produce a diagram.

## Core Features:

       A user can upload an image through a web browser or mobile device anonymously
       After upload, links provided to multiple resolutions of the uploaded image for sharing
       The platform must be cost effective

## Advanced Features:

       Cater for regular spikes for image uploads that are anticipated at certain times in the day without manual intervention
       A link shortener service that can generate a short link for individual images
       
## Extra Discussion Points:

       How will you manage building this infrastructure and application(s)?
       How would you store secrets that are used by the application (database passwords, etc)
